I'll first start be creating the Customer class with the necessary information as attributres:
    - name : String
    - contactNumber : String
    - address : String
    - city : String
    - email : String

    within this Customer class there will be a nested/inner class called Order. This class will contain the following as attributes
   - orderNumber : String
  - meal : String
   - price : double
   - quantity : int
  - instructions : String
   - calculateTotal() : double

There must also be a Restaurant class containing:
    - name : String
    - city : String
    - contactNumber : String

A Customer and Restaurant object will be constructed with unspecified values at first. The user will fill in the details as they progress
through the program. The user will first enter the city of the restaurant and customer. The program must iterate through the provided drivers.txt
file and find drivers that are in the area.
	If there are drivers then the user will continue to fill in details of the customer, restaurant, and order.
	If not, an invoice with an apology will be created stating that there are no drivers to make the delilvery.

The program must include an iterator to find the driver with the lightest load. The first element of the list drivers can be assumed to be the 
one with the lightest load. The iterator will then compare the load to the rest of the drivers. If the other load is lighter, that load will assigned 
to the lowest load variable and there will be another variable containing the details of that driver who had the lower load.

At the end the program must have produced the invoice text file with details of the customer, order, and restaurant in an organised structure.
